                               define_design_lib

NAME
       define_design_lib
              Maps a design library to a UNIX directory.

SYNTAX
       status define_design_lib
               library_name
               -path directory

   Data Types
       library_name     string
       directory        string

ARGUMENTS
       library_name
              Specifies the library to be mapped.

       -path directory
              Specifies the directory to which the library is mapped.

DESCRIPTION
       The  define_design_lib  command  maps a design library to a UNIX direc-
       tory.  The directory is used to store intermediate  representations  of
       designs.

       When  define_design_lib  is  used with the design_library_file command,
       the file is automatically reread when it is changed.  As a  result,  if
       the  file  contains a library definition that was manually defined with
       define_design_lib, the manual definition is overridden.

EXAMPLES
       The following example uses define_design_lib to map the MY_LIB  library
       to the ~library directory:

         prompt> define_design_lib MY_LIB -path ~/library
