DESCRIPTION
       The  remove_path_group  command  removes a list of path groups from the
       current design.

       Path groups control the optimization cost function and timing  reports.
       You  can  see  what  path  groups  remain  in  the  design by using the
       get_path_groups command.

       To create other path groups, use the group_path command.

EXAMPLES
       The command set below first creates two  path  groups  named  grp1  and
       grp2, and then removes the groups:

         prompt> group_path -name grp1 -to data_out
         1

         prompt> group_path -name grp2 -from input3 -to data_out
         1

         prompt> remove_path_group {grp1 grp2}
         1
