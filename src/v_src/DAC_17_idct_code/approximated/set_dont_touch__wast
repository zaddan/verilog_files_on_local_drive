                                set_dont_touch

NAME
       set_dont_touch
              Sets  the  dont_touch  attribute on cells, nets, references, and
              designs in the current design, and on library cells, to  prevent
              modification  or  replacement  of these objects during optimiza-
              tion.

SYNTAX
       status set_dont_touch
               object_list
               [true | false]

   Data Types
       object_list     list

ARGUMENTS
       object_list
              Specifies list of objects (cells, nets, references, designs, and
              library  cells)  on which the dont_touch attribute is to be set,
              so that the objects will not be modified or replaced.   If  more
              than one object name is specified, each name must be enclosed in
              quotation marks (" ") or braces ({}).

       true | false
              Specifies the value with which to set the dont_touch  attribute.
              The default is true.

DESCRIPTION
       This  command sets the dont_touch attribute on cells, nets, references,
       designs in the current design, and on library cells, to prevent modifi-
       cation or replacement of these objects during optimization.

       Setting  the  dont_touch  attribute  on  a  hierarchical  cell  implies
       "dont_touch" on all cells below it that do not have dont_touch  set  to
       false.

       Setting the dont_touch attribute on a library cell implies "dont_touch"
       on all instances of that cell.  Setting the dont_touch attribute  on  a
       net  implies  "dont_touch" only on mapped combinational cells connected
       to that net.  All mapped combinational cells connected to the net  must
       be at the same level of hierarchy.

       Note  that  if the enable_keep_signal_dt_net variable is set to true, a
       different mechanism is used to preserve  a  dont_touch  net.   See  the
       enable_keep_signal_dt_net man page for more information.

       Setting the dont_touch attribute on a reference implies "dont_touch" on
       all cells of that reference  during  subsequent  optimizations  of  the
       design.

       Setting  the  dont_touch  attribute on a design has an effect only when
       the design is instantiated within another design as a level of  hierar-
       chy.   In  this case, "dont_touch" on the design implies that all cells
       under that level of hierarchy are "dont_touch."  Setting dont_touch  on
       the  top-level  design  has  no  effect  because it is not instantiated
       within any other design.

       Note the following information:

        o The dont_touch attribute is ignored on nets that have unmapped cells
         on them.

        o  The  dont_touch attribute applied by the tool on the cells and nets
         in the transitive fanout of dont_touch_network objects overrides  the
         false  dont_touch  attribute  value that is set by the set_dont_touch
         command.  You can see the dont_touch value on cells or nets by  using
         the report_cell or report_net command.

        o  Setting  the  dont_touch attribute on unmapped cells in Design Com-
         piler topographical mode causes the  compile_ultra  command  to  fail
         during execution.

        o  Setting  the  dont_touch  attribute  on selectops and their control
         logic is not supported if this logic resides at the top level of  the
         design.

        o  A dont_touch attribute on a clock gating cell or its parent hierar-
         chical cell will prevent clock gating optimizations from removing  or
         modifying it.

        o  The dont_touch attribute should be removed by remove_attribute com-
         mand. It is not equivalent to set_dont_touch to false which will have
         its   meaning   depending  on  the  context.   E.g.  its  parent  has
         set_dont_touch is true.  In the DC Explorer flow,  set_dont_touch  to
         false  on  a  cell  will  be ignored if none of the cell's parent has
         dont_touch set to true.  In this case, the cell may be optimized away
         during  compile.  If the cell does not get optimized away during com-
         pile, the dont_touch false attribute may still be lost after compile.

       The dont_touch attribute affects DFT insertion as follows:

        o  The  dont_touch  attribute indirectly affects DFT insertion by pre-
         venting the cell type from being changed.  It  is  ignored  for  scan
         stitching,  test  signal routing, logic insertion. It is also ignored
         when an identified shift register is split by the scan architect; the
         head  scan  flip-flops  of  any new shift register segments are scan-
         replaced even if they have the dont_touchfP attribute applied.

        o A dont_touch attribute applied to a nonscan  sequential  cell  keeps
         the  cell as a nonscan cell. It will not be scan-replaced or stitched
         into scan chains. However, nonscan cells identified as shift register
         elements can be stitched into scan chains.

        o  A  dont_touch  attribute  applied  to  a test-ready (scan-replaced)
         sequential cell keeps the cell as a scan-replaced cell. If  the  cell
         is  a  valid  scan cell, it will be stitched into scan chains. If not
         (due to DRC violations or other directives such  as  set_scan_element
         false), it will remain as an unstitched test-ready cell.

       When  an  object  name  is  specified, the set_dont_touch command first
       looks within the current design for a cell that matches that name.   If
       it  finds a match, a dont_touch attribute is assigned to that cell.  If
       no match is found, the command next looks within the current design for
       a  net  that  matches  the  specified  name.   If  a  match is found, a
       dont_touch attribute is assigned to that net.  If no  match  is  found,
       the  command  next  looks for a reference, then a design in the system,
       and finally for a library cell  in  the  system.  The  tool  assigns  a
       dont_touch attribute to the first object for which it finds a match.

       To remove the dont_touch attribute, use the remove_attribute command.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command has no dependency on scenario-specific information.

EXAMPLES
       The following example specifies that the cells named block1 and analog1
       are not to be modified during optimization:

         prompt> set_dont_touch [get_cells {block1 analog1}]

       The following example specifies the removal of the dont_touch attribute
       from the cell named block1:

         prompt> remove_attribute [get_cells block1] dont_touch

       The following example specifies that the net named N1 is not to be mod-
       ified during optimization:

         prompt> set_dont_touch [get_nets N1] true
