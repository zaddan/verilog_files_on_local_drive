ARGUMENTS
       -setup Specifies  that  the  setup checking (maximum delay) is reset to
              single cycle behavior.

       -hold  Specifies that the hold checking (minimum  delay)  is  reset  to
              single cycle behavior.

       -rise  Specifies  that the rising path delays are reset to single cycle
              behavior.  The default is that both rising  and  falling  delays
              are affected.

       -fall  Specifies  that  falling  path  delays  are  set to single cycle
              behavior.  The default is that both rising  and  falling  delays
              are affected.

       -from from_list
              Specifies  the  names  of  clocks, pins, or cells to use to find
              path startpoints.  If a specified object is a clock,  all  flip-
              flops,  latches,  and  primary  inputs related to that clock are
              used as path startpoints.

       -rise_from rise_from_list
              Specifies the names of clocks, pins, or cells  to  use  to  find
              path  startpoints.   This option is similar to the -from option,
              except that the path must rise from the objects specified.  If a
              clock  object  is  specified,  this  option  selects startpoints
              clocked by the named clock, but only the paths launched by  ris-
              ing  edge  of the clock at the clock source, taking into account
              any logical inversions along the clock path.  You can  use  only
              one of -from, -rise_from, and -fall_from.

       -fall_from fall_from_list
              Specifies  the  names  of  clocks, pins, or cells to use to find
              path startpoints.  This option is similar to the  -from  option,
              except that the path must fall from the objects specified.  If a
              clock object  is  specified,  this  option  selects  startpoints
              clocked  by  the  named  clock,  but  only the paths launched by
              falling edge of the clock  at  the  clock  source,  taking  into
              account  any  logical  inversions along the clock path.  You can
              use only one of -from, -rise_from, and -fall_from.

       -through through_list
              Specifies a list of path throughpoints (port, pin, or leaf  cell
              names)  of  the  current design.  The reset_path applies only to
              paths that pass through one of the points in  the  through_list.
              If  more  than  one  object  is  included,  the  objects must be
              enclosed either in quotation marks ("") or in braces  ({}).   If
              you  specify  the -through option multiple times, the reset_path
              applies to paths that pass through a member of each through_list
              in the order the lists are given.  In other words, the path must
              first pass through a member  of  the  first  through_list,  then
              through a member of the second list, and so on for every through
              list specified.  If you use the -through option  in  combination
              with  the  -from  or -to options, the reset_path applies only if
              the -from or -to conditions are satisfied and the -through  con-
              ditions are satisfied.

       -rise_through rise_through_list
              Specifies  a list of path throughpoints (port, pin, or leaf cell
              names) of the current design.  This option  is  similar  to  the
              -through option, but applies only to paths with a rising transi-
              tion at the specified objects.  You  can  specify  -rise_through
              more  than  once  in  a  single  command  invocation as with the
              -through option.

       -fall_through fall_through_list
              Specifies a list of path throughpoints (port, pin, or leaf  cell
              names)  of  the  current  design.  This option is similar to the
              -through option, but applies only to paths with a falling  tran-
              sition  at the specified objects.  You can specify -fall_through
              more than once in  a  single  command  invocation  as  with  the
              -through option.

       -to to_list
              Specifies  the  names  of  clocks, pins, or cells to use to find
              path endpoints.  If a specified object is  a  clock,  all  flip-
              flops,  latches,  and  primary outputs related to that clock are
              used as path endpoints.

       -rise_to rise_to_list
              Specifies the names of clocks, pins, or cells  to  use  to  find
              path  endpoints.   This option is similar to the -to option, but
              applies only to paths rising at the endpoint.  If a clock object
              is specified, this option selects endpoints clocked by the named
              clock, but only the paths captured by rising edge of  the  clock
              at  clock  source,  taking  into  account any logical inversions
              along the clock path.  You can use only one  of  -to,  -rise_to,
              and -fall_to.

       -fall_to fall_to_list
              Specifies  the  names  of  clocks, pins, or cells to use to find
              path endpoints.  This option is similar to the -to  option,  but
              applies  only  to  paths  falling  at  the endpoint.  If a clock
              object is specified, this option selects  endpoints  clocked  by
              the  named clock, but only the paths launched by falling edge of
              the clock at the clock source, taking into account  any  logical
              inversions  along  the clock path.  You can use only one of -to,
              -rise_to, and -fall_to.

DESCRIPTION
       This command specifies that designated  timing  paths  in  the  current
       design  are  restored  to  the  default  single  cycle  behavior.   The
       reset_path command is used to  undo  the  effect  of  the  set_multicy-
       cle_path,  set_false_path,  set_max_delay,  and set_min_delay commands.
       Remove the attributes set by those commands with reset_path.  Note that
       a  general reset_path command removes the effect of matching general or
       specific point-to-point exception commands.

       If you do not specify -setup or -hold, both are restored to the default
       behavior.   The  default  is  a  setup relation of one cycle and a hold
       relation of 0 cycles.  A hold value of 0 means that hold is checked one
       active edge before the setup data at the destination register.

       If  you specify -setup, only setup (maximum delay) checking is reset to
       the default behavior.  If you specify -hold, only hold (minimum  delay)
       checking is reset to the default behavior.

       There  is  separate  setup  and hold information for rise and fall.  In
       most cases, these are reset together.  The -rise or -fall  options  are
       used to reset only one or the other.

       To disable setup or hold calculations for paths, use the set_false_path
       command.

       To see  the  nondefault  path  requirements  on  the  design,  use  the
       report_timing_requirements command.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command uses information from the current scenario only.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  resets  the timing relation between ff1/CP and
       ff2/D to the default single cycle:

         prompt> reset_path -from {ff1/CP} -to {ff2/D}

       This example resets the rising delay to single cycle for all paths end-
       ing at latch2d:

         prompt> reset_path -rise -to {latch2d}

       This  example shows how a specific and general point-to-point exception
       is set and then removed:

         prompt> set_false_path 2 -from A -to Z

         prompt> set_max_delay 15 -to Z

         prompt> reset_path -to Z /* removes all exceptions to Z */
