       port_pin_list     collection

ARGUMENTS
       delay_value
              Specifies the path delay.  The delay_value must be in units con-
              sistent  with  the  technology library used during optimization.
              The delay_value represents the amount  of  time  the  signal  is
              available  after  a clock edge.  This represents a combinational
              path delay from the clock pin of a register.

       -reference_pin pin_port_name
              Specifies the clock pin or port to which the specified delay  is
              related.  If you use this option, and if propagated clocking  is
              being  used,  the  delay value is related to the arrival time at
              the specified reference pin, which is clock source latency  plus
              its network latency from the clock source to this reference pin.
              The         options         -network_latency_included        and
              -source_latency_included  cannot be used at the same time as the
              -reference_pin  option.  For  ideal  clock  network, only source
              latency is applied.

              The  pin  specified  with  the -reference_pin option should be a
              leaf pin or port in a clock network, in the direct or transitive
              fanout  of  a  clock source specified with the -clock option. If
              multiple clocks reach the port or pin where you are setting  the
              input  delay,  and if the -clock option is not used, the command
              considers all of the clocks.

       -clock clock_name
              Specifies the clock to which the specified delay is related.  If
              -clock_fall is used, -clock clock_name must  be  specified.   If
              -clock  is not specified, the delay is relative to time zero for
              combinational designs.  For sequential  designs,  the  delay  is
              considered relative to a new clock with the period determined by
              considering the sequential cells in  the  transitive  fanout  of
              each port.

              The  clock_name  can  be  either  a  string or collection of one
              object.

       -clock_fall
              Specifies that the delay is relative to the falling edge of  the
              clock.  The default is the rising edge.

       -level_sensitive
              Specifies  that  the  source  of  the delay is a level-sensitive
              latch.  This allows the tool to derive the setup and hold  rela-
              tionship for paths from this port as if the port is a level-sen-
              sitive latch.  If -level_sensitive is not used, the input  delay
              is treated as if it is a path from a flip-flop.

       -network_latency_included
              Specifies  that  the  clock  network latency is not added to the
              input delay value.  If this option is not specified,  the  clock
              network latency of the related clock is added to the input delay
              value.  It has no effect if the clock is propagated or the input
              delay is not specified with respect to any clock.

       -source_latency_included
              Specifies  that  the  clock  source  latency is not added to the
              input delay value.  If this option is not specified,  the  clock
              source  latency  of the related clock will be added to the input
              delay value.  It has no effect if the input delay is not  speci-
              fied with respect to any clock.

       -rise  Specifies  that  delay_value  refers  to  a rising transition on
              specified ports of the current design.   If  neither  -rise  nor
              -fall  is specified, rising and falling delays are assumed to be
              equal.

       -fall  Specifies that delay_value refers to  a  falling  transition  on
              specified  ports  of  the  current design.  If neither -rise nor
              -fall is specified, rising and falling delays are assumed equal.

       -max   Specifies  that delay_value refers to the longest path.  If nei-
              ther -max nor -min  is  specified,  maximum  and  minimum  input
              delays are assumed equal.

       -min   Specifies that delay_value refers to the shortest path.  If nei-
              ther -max nor -min  is  specified,  maximum  and  minimum  input
              delays are assumed equal.

       -add_delay
              Specifies whether to add delay information to the existing input
              delay or to overwrite.  The -add_delay  option  enables  you  to
              capture  information  about  multiple  paths leading to an input
              port that are relative to different clocks or clock edges.

              For example, the following command  removes  all  other  maximum
              rise  input  delay  from  A,  since -add_delay is not specified.
              Other input delay with a different clock or with -clock_fall  is
              removed.

                set_input_delay 5.0 -max -rise -clock phi1 {A}

              In  the following example, -add_delay is specified.  If there is
              an input maximum rise delay for A relative to clock phi1  rising
              edge,  the  larger  value  is  used.  The smaller value will not
              result in critical timing for maximum delay.  For minimum delay,
              the smaller value is used.  If there is maximum rise input delay
              relative to a different clock or  different  edge  of  the  same
              clock, it remains with the new delay.

                prompt> set_input_delay 5.0 -max -rise -clock phi1 -add_delay {A}

       port_pin_list
              Specifies a list of input port or internal pin names in the cur-
              rent design to which delay_value is assigned.  If more than  one
              object  is specified, the objects are enclosed in quotes ("") or
              in braces ({}).  If input delay is specified on a pin, the  cell
              of  the pin is set to size only to leave room for compile apply-
              ing sizing on it.

DESCRIPTION
       The set_input_delay command sets input path delay values for  the  cur-
       rent  design.   Used  with set_load and set_driving_cell, the input and
       output delays characterize the operating  environment  of  the  current
       design.

       A  path  starts from a primary input or clock of sequential element and
       ends at a sequential element or primary output.  The delay_value to  be
       specified  is  the delay between the startpoint and the object on which
       the set_input_delay is being set, relative to the clock edge.

       The set_input_delay command sets input path delays on input ports rela-
       tive  to  a  clock  edge.   Input  ports are assumed to have zero input
       delay, unless specified.  For  inout  (bidirectional)  ports,  you  can
       specify the path delays for both input and output modes.

       To  describe  a  path  delay  from  a  level-sensitive  latch,  use the
       -level_sensitive option.  If the latch  is  positive-enabled,  set  the
       input  delay  relative  to  the  rising  clock edge; if it is negative-
       enabled, set the input delay relative to the falling  clock  edge.   If
       time  is  being  borrowed  at that latch, add that time borrowed to the
       path delay from the latch when determining input delay.

       The characterize command automatically sets  input  and  output  delay,
       drive, and load values based on the environment of a cell instance.

       The  timer adds input delay to path delay for paths starting at primary
       inputs and output delay for paths ending at primary outputs.

       Use the report_port command to list input delays associated with ports.

       To list input delays of internal pins, use report_design.

       Use remove_input_delay or reset_design to remove input delay values.

       This command applies to the current scenario only.

EXAMPLES
       The  following example sets an input delay of 2.3 for ports IN1 and IN2
       on a combinational design.  Because the  design  is  combinational,  no
       clock is needed.

         prompt> set_input_delay 2.3 {IN1 IN2}

       The  following  example uses a clock collection and sets an input delay
       of 1.2 relative to the rising edge of CLK1 for all input ports  in  the
       design:

         prompt> set_input_delay 1.2 -clock [get_clocks CLK1] [all_inputs]

       The following example sets the input and output delays for the bidirec-
       tional port INOUT1.  The input signal arrives at INOUT1 2.5 units after
       the  falling  edge of CLK1.  The output signal is required at INOUT1 at
       1.4 units before the rising edge of CLK2.

         prompt> set_input_delay 2.5 -clock CLK1 -clock_fall {INOUT1}
         prompt> set_output_delay 1.4 -clock CLK2 {INOUT1}

       The following example has three paths to the IN1 input  port.   One  of
       the paths is relative to the rising edge of CLK1.  Another path is rel-
       ative to the falling edge of CLK1.  The third path is relative  to  the
       falling  edge  of CLK2.  The -add_delay option is used to indicate that
       new input delay information  will  not  cause  old  information  to  be
       removed.

         prompt> set_input_delay 2.2 -max -clock CLK1 -add_delay {IN1}
         prompt> set_input_delay 1.7 -max -clock CLK1 -clock_fall \
            -add_delay {IN1}
         prompt> set_input_delay 4.3 -max -clock CLK2 -clock_fall \
            -add_delay {IN1}

       In  this  example,  two different maximum delays and two minimum delays
       for port A are specified using  the  -add_delay  option.   Because  the
       information  is  relative  to  the  same clock and clock edge, only the
       largest of the maximum values and the smallest of  the  minimum  values
       are  maintained,  in this 5.0 and 1.1.  If the -add_delay option is not
       used, the new information overwrites the old information.

         prompt> set_input_delay 3.4 -max -clock CLK1 -add_delay {A}
         prompt> set_input_delay 5.0 -max -clock CLK1 -add_delay {A}
         prompt> set_input_delay 1.1 -min -clock CLK1 -add_delay {A}
         prompt> set_input_delay 1.3 -min -clock CLK1 -add_delay {A}
