                                  set_flatten

NAME
       set_flatten
              Sets or removes the flatten attribute on specified designs or on
              the current design, to enable or disable  the  flattening  opti-
              mization step during compile.

SYNTAX
       int set_flatten
               [true | false]
               [-effort low | medium | high]
               [-minimize single_output | multiple_output | none]
               [-phase true | false]  [-design design_list] [-quiet]

   Data Types
       design_list     list

ARGUMENTS
       true | false
              When  true,  sets  the  flatten  attribute  on  the  designs  in
              design_list and enables  flattening  for  those  designs.   When
              false  (the default value), the flatten attribute is removed and
              flattening is turned off for those designs.

       -effort low | medium | high
              Indicates the level of CPU effort that compile uses to flatten a
              design.  The default is low.

       -minimize single_output | multiple_output | none
              Indicates the minimization strategy to be used after a design is
              flattened.  If single_output (the default  value),  Design  Com-
              piler independently minimizes the equations for each output in a
              design.  If multiple_output, Design Compiler minimizes all logic
              for  a  design.  If none, Design Compiler does not perform mini-
              mization.

       -phase true | false
              When true, allows logic flattening to invert the phase  of  out-
              puts  during  compile.   When  false  (the default value), logic
              flattening does not invert the phase of outputs.  This option is
              used only if the flatten attribute is set.

       -design design_list
              Specifies a list of designs to be flattened.  The default is the
              current design.

       -quiet Indicates that warning messages are not to be displayed.

DESCRIPTION
       Sets or removes the flatten attribute on specified designs  or  on  the
       current  design, enabling or disabling the flattening optimization step
       during compile.  If no options are specified, the flatten attribute  is
       set on the current design.

       To enable flattening during optimization across the entire design hier-
       archy, issue the set_flatten command on the top design and each  subde-
       sign.  To display the values of all flatten attributes, use report_com-
       pile_options.

       This optimization step reduces a logic network to a  two-level  sum-of-
       products  (AND/OR)  representation  by  removing all intermediate vari-
       ables.  Full flattening eliminates all existing  logic  structure.   By
       removing  sub-optimal  intermediate  variables,  compile is able to use
       other intermediate variables that otherwise might not have been  found.

       If  phase  assignment has been enabled by invoking the set_flatten com-
       mand with -phase true, then the flattening optimization step in compile
       will  compare  the  implementation  of  each logic equation in both its
       original and complemented form and choose the form  with  the  smallest
       estimated area.

       When the minimization strategy is set to single_output, Design Compiler
       minimizes the equations for each output individually.  This results  in
       the  smallest implementation for each output, but the design as a whole
       might not be the most efficient because product  (AND  terms)  are  not
       well  shared  between  outputs.   When the strategy is multiple_output,
       Design Compiler minimizes all the logic for a  design,  and  shares  as
       many product terms between outputs as possible.

       NOTE:   Setting  the flatten attribute can potentially cause compile to
       have long run times or to run out of memory, because  logic  flattening
       and and equation minimization is a potentially exponential process.  If
       you encounter an "out of memory" error or excessive run time,  you  can
       modify  the  options  one at a time and re-run after each modification.
       Here is the recommended order for modifying the options:

       1.  Use single_output instead of multiple_output minimization strategy.
       2.  Use the -phase false option instead of the default -phase true option.
       3.  Use a lower effort setting.

       To remove  the  flatten  attribute,  use  remove_attribute  or  execute
       set_flatten  false.   reset_design  removes  all  attributes, including
       flatten.

       For more details on flattening during optimization, refer to the Design
       Compiler Reference Manual: Optimization and Timing Analysis.

EXAMPLES
       In this example, flatten is enabled on the design "TEST".

              prompt> set_flatten -design TEST

       In  this  example,  flatten  is  enabled on the current design with the
       effort and minimize options specified, and flatten is disabled  on  the
       design "OLD."

              prompt> read TEST
              prompt> set_flatten -effort high -minimize multiple_output
              prompt> set_flatten -design OLD false
