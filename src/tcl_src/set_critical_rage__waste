                              set_critical_range

NAME
       set_critical_range
              Sets the critical_range attribute to a specified value on a list
              of designs.

SYNTAX
       status set_critical_range
               range_value
               designs

   Data Types
       range_value     float
       designs         list

ARGUMENTS
       range_value
              Specifies the value to which the critical_range attribute is  to
              be set.

       designs
              Indicates  the  list  of  designs  to  which  the critical_range
              attribute applies.

DESCRIPTION
       This command sets the critical_range attribute to the  specified  value
       on the specified designs.

       The  tool  uses the critical_range attribute of the top-level design as
       the default critical range for path groups that do not have a  critical
       range  set.   If you do not set the critical_range attribute, such path
       groups get a critical range of 0.0.  You can assign critical range val-
       ues  to individual path groups with the group_path -critical_range com-
       mand.

       Critical range specifies a margin of delay for path groups in optimiza-
       tion.   This  must be a positive float number or 0.0.  A critical range
       of 0.0 means that only the most critical paths (the ones with the worst
       violation)  are  optimized.   If  you specify a nonzero critical range,
       near-critical paths within that amount of the worst path will  also  be
       optimized, if possible.

       To  undo  set_critical_range,  use the remove_attribute or reset_design
       command.

       To show the  critical  range  values  for  each  path  group,  use  the
       report_path_group  command.   To  show  the  critical range cost of the
       design, use the report_constraint command.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command applies to the current scenario only.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sets the  default  critical  range  for  the  top
       design to 10.0:

         prompt> set_critical_range 10.0 top
